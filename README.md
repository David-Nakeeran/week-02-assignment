## Overview

- Created an image gallery site, making sure to incorporate web accessibility.
- Achieved all requirements and all stretch goals

## Reflection

- I wonder if I should have used grid on the body and had the large image container fill the whole grid. As I believe I can have other elements overlapping more easily that using position absolute. Maybe worth a try on the next project!
